# OParl-ProofOfConcept
This project is a proof of concept for a simple use case using the OParl standard.

## What's this project all about?
Currently the OParl standard is being developed. This standard is an API which should enable easier access to RIS (Ratsinformationssystemen) throughout Germany.

This project implements a simple use case to test the possibilities and usability of the OParl API.

## Project Idea
The implemented web server searches for all information that can be found to a certain topic (e.g. "Fahrrad / Radfahrer / etc.") in a specific time range (e.g. last two years).

The OParl standard hasn't been released yet, but there is a dummy implementation on [https://politik-bei-uns.de/oparl](https://politik-bei-uns.de/oparl) which serves scraped data for the cities  Bochum, KÃ¶ln and Moers via the OParl API. This service is used for the project.
